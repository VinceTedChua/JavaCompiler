# Creation of Compiler via Java Programming.


# What is a Compiler? 

A compiler is a high level language that converts a program to understandable readable machine code. 
Languages such as Java, C++ and beynd provides a flexible overview of how a compiler functions.

# Here is how it is conveyed through phases of Compiler:

My Group and I are here to present you the main gist of the logic to better understand it: 

# Step 1: Lexical or they call it as "Scanner" 
-A source code identfying the meaning of the programming languages
-What type of variables, operators or delimiters..

# Step 2: Syntax Analysis "Parser" 

-Compiling phase checking if the programming language is implemented gramatically true.

# Step 3: Semantic Analysis 

-It checks the code for errors that was implemented to the rules of programming

# The other steps not mentioned but we will distinguish: Intermediate Programming, Code Optimization and Fully Optimized Programming.

-Intermediate Programming Code Generation - translates the code into intermediate code to generate for better efficiency.

-Code Optimization translates the intermediate into machine code and output is executed best by computer's hardware which follows the Fully Optimized Idea.

# Clear 

-Eliminates the mentioned of the 4 to start over if error occurs. 


Without Further ado, this is our Presentation for the Compiler kindly check
src/JavaCompiler for the code solutions, thanks!
